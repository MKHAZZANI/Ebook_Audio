## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

You can use the application in two ways: through the graphical user interface (GUI) or the command-line interface (CLI).

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for converting your ebooks.

-   **Windows:**

    ```bash
    python app_gui.py
    ```

-   **macOS / Linux:**

    ```bash
    python3 app_gui.py
    ```

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is perfect for power users and for integrating the converter into scripts.

-   **Windows:**

    ```bash
    python converter\core\src\main.py convert <your_ebook.txt>
    ```

-   **macOS / Linux:**

    ```bash
    python3 converter/core/src/main.py convert <your_ebook.txt>
    ```

**CLI Options:**

-   `--output`: Specify the output audio file path. Defaults to `output.wav`.

    *Example:*

    ```bash
    python converter\core\src\main.py convert my_book.pdf --output my_audiobook.wav
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

-   **`pyttsx3` issues:** If you encounter issues with the `pyttsx3` engine, it might be due to a problem with the local speech synthesis engine on your system. We recommend using the `edge-tts` engine for the best results.
-   **Permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the ebook file and write the output audio file.
